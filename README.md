- Rickroll blocks are crafted from 9 rickroll ingots (the block can be crafted back into the ingots)

- Animated rickrolls are crafted with 8 diamonds surrounding a rickroll item
- Animated rickroll blocks are crafted with 8 diamonds surrounding a rickroll block

It is called "Ultimate Rickrolling" there because the review team didn't like "Mod" being part of the mod name.

### Credits
- This is my first Minecraft mod, it is largely based off of [cubicoder's tutorial for modding 1.12.2](https://cubicoder.github.io/tutorials/1-12-2/tutorials/)
- To avoid copyright issues, the rickroll music disc does not play the original ["Never Gonna Give You Up"](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) song by Rick Astley. It is instead a Minecraft note block cover by grande1899 which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/lXCCv8MEYiU).
- And of course, Rick Astley.
